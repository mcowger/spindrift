# Spindrift CNC Protocol Implementation - Progress Log

## Project Goal
Rebuild an existing CNC protocol implementation in Python to make it properly modular, remove Kivy frontend dependencies, and refactor into a reusable library.

## Completed Work

### Session 1 - Initial Setup and Mock Server Implementation

#### ✅ Repository Initialization
- Set up Poetry for package and runtime management
- Configured pytest for testing framework
- Created skeleton VS Code configuration (launch.json, tasks.json)
- Established basic project structure with spindrift package

#### ✅ Mock CNC Server Implementation
- **Core Server**: Implemented TCP server on port 2222 that simulates real CNC machine behavior
- **Command Support**: Full support for all command types from artifacts/commands.json:
  - G-codes (G0, G1, G2, etc.)
  - M-codes (M3, M5, M6, etc.)
  - Console commands (help, version, mem, ls, etc.)
  - Host commands ($G, $I, $H, $J, ?, etc.)
- **JSON-Driven Responses**: Uses actual response data from commands.json instead of hardcoded values
- **Real TCP Implementation**: Uses asyncio TCP server (not testing mocks) for external tool compatibility

#### ✅ Hardware-Accurate Behavior
- **Auto-disconnect**: 10-second timeout disconnects inactive clients (matches real hardware)
- **Concurrent Rejection**: Only allows one active connection at a time
- **Response Timing**: Minimum 100ms delays with command-specific timing from JSON
- **Multiple Commands**: Handles multiple commands per connection session

#### ✅ Development Experience

  - Other connections remain functional during transfers
  - Exact protocol timing and behavior matching real hardware

  - Error responses get EOT termination
  - No special handling needed - uses generic system

#### ✅ Comprehensive Testing and Validation
- **Functionality Testing**: Verified all mkdir command scenarios
  - ✅ Create new directory: `mkdir /sd/test_dir` → `ok\x04\n`
  - ✅ Duplicate directory error: proper error message with EOT
  - ✅ File name conflict error: proper error message with EOT
  - ✅ Missing parameter error: proper error message with EOT
  - ✅ Directory listing: new directory appears with trailing slash
- **Metadata Verification**: Confirmed correct virtual filesystem storage
  - ✅ Size: -1 (as specified)
  - ✅ Path: Ends with trailing slash
  - ✅ Contents: Empty string
  - ✅ MD5: Empty string
  - ✅ Timestamp: Current timestamp in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format
- **Integration Testing**: Verified compatibility with existing commands
  - ✅ ls command shows new directories correctly
  - ✅ EOT termination works for all response types
  - ✅ No regression in existing filesystem functionality

### Session 13 - Debug-Only Logging Implementation

#### ✅ Commands.json Configuration Enhancement
- **Debug Output Field**: Added "debug_output_only" boolean field to commands.json
  - Applied to status command ("?") as initial implementation
  - Provides granular control over logging verbosity per command
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing command definitions
- **Selective Logging Control**: Framework for reducing log noise
  - Commands marked with "debug_output_only": true log only at DEBUG level
  - Other commands continue to log at INFO level as before
  - Allows fine-tuning of log output for different command types

#### ✅ Logging System Enhancement
- **Dynamic Log Level Selection**: Modified command and response logging logic
  - Checks "debug_output_only" field in command definition
  - Uses DEBUG level for commands with debug_output_only=true
  - Uses INFO level for all other commands (default behavior)
- **Dual Logging Points**: Applied to both command reception and response sending
  - Command received (RECV) logging respects debug_output_only setting
  - Response sent (SEND) logging respects debug_output_only setting
  - Consistent behavior across entire command lifecycle

#### ✅ Status Command Implementation
- **Noise Reduction**: Status command ("?") now logs only at DEBUG level
  - Status queries are frequent and can create log noise
  - Still fully functional - only logging level changed
  - Visible when running server with --verbose flag
- **Preserved Functionality**: No change to command behavior or responses
  - Status command still returns full machine state information
  - Response format and content unchanged
  - Only logging verbosity affected

#### ✅ Framework for Future Expansion
- **Scalable Design**: Easy to add debug_output_only to other commands
  - Simple boolean field addition to any command in commands.json
  - No code changes required for additional commands
  - Consistent behavior across all command types
- **Logging Flexibility**: Supports different logging strategies
  - Can mark frequently-used commands as debug-only
  - Keeps important commands visible at INFO level
  - Allows customization based on operational needs
