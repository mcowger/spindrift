# Spindrift CNC Protocol Implementation - Progress Log

## Project Goal
Rebuild an existing CNC protocol implementation in Python to make it properly modular, remove Kivy frontend dependencies, and refactor into a reusable library.

## Completed Work

### Session 1 - Initial Setup and Mock Server Implementation

#### ✅ Repository Initialization
- Set up Poetry for package and runtime management
- Configured pytest for testing framework
- Created skeleton VS Code configuration (launch.json, tasks.json)
- Established basic project structure with spindrift package

#### ✅ Mock CNC Server Implementation
- **Core Server**: Implemented TCP server on port 2222 that simulates real CNC machine behavior
- **Command Support**: Full support for all command types from artifacts/commands.json:
  - G-codes (G0, G1, G2, etc.)
  - M-codes (M3, M5, M6, etc.) 
  - Console commands (help, version, mem, ls, etc.)
  - Host commands ($G, $I, $H, $J, ?, etc.)
- **JSON-Driven Responses**: Uses actual response data from commands.json instead of hardcoded values
- **Real TCP Implementation**: Uses asyncio TCP server (not testing mocks) for external tool compatibility

#### ✅ Hardware-Accurate Behavior
- **Auto-disconnect**: 10-second timeout disconnects inactive clients (matches real hardware)
- **Concurrent Rejection**: Only allows one active connection at a time
- **Response Timing**: Minimum 100ms delays with command-specific timing from JSON
- **Multiple Commands**: Handles multiple commands per connection session

#### ✅ Development Experience
- **Colored Logging**: Beautiful bracketed format `[LEVEL   ] [HH:MM:SS] message` with colored levels
- **Reusable Logging**: Created spindrift/logging_config.py for project-wide consistency
- **CLI Integration**: Combined CLI functionality into mock_server.py for simplicity
- **Test Scripts**: Comprehensive test scripts for functionality and timeout verification

#### ✅ Package Management
- Poetry-based dependency management
- CLI entry point: `poetry run spindrift mock-server`
- Direct module execution: `python -m spindrift.mock_server mock-server`
- Proper package structure for library distribution

## Current Status
- **Mock Server**: Complete and fully functional
- **Next Phase**: Ready to begin actual CNC protocol implementation refactoring
- **Architecture**: Foundation established for modular library development

## Technical Decisions Made
1. **Poetry over pip**: Better dependency management and virtual environment handling
2. **Asyncio TCP**: Real networking for external tool compatibility vs test mocks
3. **JSON-driven responses**: Maintainable, single source of truth for command behavior
4. **Combined CLI**: Simplified architecture by merging cli.py into mock_server.py
5. **Colored logging**: Enhanced development experience with consistent formatting
